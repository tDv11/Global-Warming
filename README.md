# Global-Warming

Global warming and climate change are terms for the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system and its related effects.
although multiple lines of scientific evidence show that the climate system is warming,  On 12 November 2015, NASA scientists reported that human-made carbon dioxide (CO2) continues to increase above levels not seen in hundreds of thousands of years and the graph of Israel listed below show's a drastic rising of temperature, the earch can still save it's self.
I assume that the climate change in earth is like a sinus wave, it goes up and down, almost as if the earth keep changing he's Min and Max temperatue to "fix himself".

- [ ] I took data of min, max and avrg temperature that was recorded in Israel,USA and Jamaica.
- [ ] I looked for the highest temperature that was recorded for each year for the last 15 years or so.
- [ ] I have substract from the highest temperatue of 2015 each highste temperature of each year for the last 15 years to see the correlation.





### A graph that show's the highest average day temperature of the last 15 years in Israel, US and Jamaica:
